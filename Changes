Revision history for Perl module MP3::Tag, MP3::Tag::ID3v1, MP3::Tag::ID3v2

Release Name: 0.21
==================
Changes:

* tk-tag has lots of new functions (see tk-tag README)
* getFrameIDs returns now always a hash ref of all existing frames, not only
  when called the first time
* Some minor problems in documentation are corrected.
* ID3v2::add_frame returns the name of the newly created frame, which can
  differ from the short name when already such a frame exists.

Release Name: 0.20 (beta)
========================
Changes:

--due to problems when run at windows:
  * Added a second seek to ID3v1::write_tag, as windows writes at a wrong 
    position otherwise
  * Setting Filehandle to binmode after opening a mp3 file 
  * ID3v2: write_tag creates a temp file (if neccessary) now in the same
    directory where the original mp3 files is located and not in /tmp

* Added tk-tag.pl, a graphical interface for MP3::Tag. tk-tag.pl is a alpha
  version
* Added a new manpage MP3::Tag::ID3v2-Data which contains information about
  the ID3v2 frames and the data returned by MP3::Tag::Id3v2::getFrame() 
* Frames RVRB ("Reverb"), COMR ("Commercial frame"), AENC ("Audio encryption"),
  GRID ("Group identification registration"), RBUF ("Recommended buffer size")
  and SYTC ("Synchronized lyric/text") are now supported	
* Added some test to test.pl for creating new tags
* ID3v2::getFrameIDs returns now a hash reference, which contains the found
  frames. The keys are the 4 byte codes of the frames, which are needed for
  getFrame . The according values are the english (long) names of the frames.
* ID3v2::write_tag - Updating tagsize after writing tag 
* ID3v1::all() returns in array context all fields, otherwise only the song
* MP3::ID3v1::write_tag didn't returned an error if a file couldn't be opened
  for writing. Now it does.
* Renamed MP3::TAG to MP3::Tag following a suggestion of ANDK from CPAN
* Makefile.PL : Added that Compress::Zlib and File::Basename is needed for 
  installation of MP3::Tag

Release Name: 0.1 (beta)
========================
Changes:
* Added documentation to the modules

* Writing/removing of ID3v2.3 tags is supported now 
* Adding, changing, removing frames of ID3v2.3 is supported

* Changed directory structure
* Added file for proper install of modules


Release Name: 0.2-alpha
=======================
Changes: 
* ID3v2.3 compressed frames are supported now 
* changed directory structure, support librarys for MP3::Tag are now in a
  subdirectory 
* tagged.pl calls xview to show pictures, which were found in ID3v2 tags
  (sorry, not configurable at the moment, but easy to change in tagged.pl)

Release Name: 0.1-alpha
=======================
This is the first alpha version. It contains perl modules to
read ID3v1/ID3v2 tags, but they are still lacking a lot of
features. 

* Reading / Writing ID3v1 works
* Reading of most frames of ID3v2.3 works

Included is a demo program tagged.pl, and a program to change ID3v1
tags and to set automatically the filename of a mp3 file: tagit.pl See
README.txt for details. More documentation is still lacking. Sorry.
