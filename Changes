=======================
Changes:

* changed directory structure, support librarys for MP3::Tag are now in a
  subdirectory 
* tagged.pl calls xview to show pictures, which were found in ID3v2 tags
  (sorry, not configurable at the moment, but easy to change in tagged.pl)

Release Name: 0.1-alpha
=======================
This is the first alpha version. It contains perl modules to
read ID3v1/ID3v2 tags, but they are still lacking a lot of
features. 

* Reading / Writing ID3v1 works
* Reading of most frames of ID3v2.3 works

Included is a demo program tagged.pl, and a program to change ID3v1
tags and to set automatically the filename of a mp3 file: tagit.pl See
README.txt for details. More documentation is still lacking. Sorry.
