====================================================================

This program is a graphical interface for the MP3::Tag library.

Most buttons do not have a function yet.

But is shows you already the contents of the ID3v1/ID3v1.1 and ID3v2.3
tags and let you change and save these tags.
If you change something, the changes will only be saved if you click
on 'Save changes' or press Control-S. This is the same after using
the remove button. Without saving the changes, nothing will be removed
permanently. 

Following functions work already:
	- open a directory
        - select a file form the filelist with a double click or by
          pressing Enter
        - Filter the filelist with the buttons below the filelist.
          In the Entry-field you can type a regular expression, which
          will be used for filtering.
	- You can edit all fields of the ID3v1 and ID3v2 tags, except a binary
	  data field of a ID3v2 tag. You can also edit the filename.
          During editing you can use Control-U, Control-u, Control-l to 
          switch a whole field to UPPERCASE, Uppercase First or lowercase.
	  In the filename field you can use Control-Space to switch spaces
          to underscore or vice versa (toggling).
	- You can use the information of a ID3v1 tag to set the filename
	  (see Options->Fileformat and documentation below)
	- You can remove the whole ID3v1 or ID3v2 Tag. And even the whole file
	  with the remove button, or by deleting the filename. (Remember to
	  save the changes to really delete it).
	- You can remove or add frames to a ID3v2 frame
	- If you enter data in a tag which doesn't exist yet (red background color)
	  it will be automatically created when you save the changes.
	
If you select several filenames at once, another frame will appear. Later it
should be possible to apply some of the above functions automatically to
a group of files (hence the filter function and Control-A for select all).
By now deselect the files and the normal frame will reappear. 

To use this program, you must have the Tk and Tk::JPEG modules from
CPAN installed. And of course MP3::Tag.

Filename format
===============

To set the filename from the data in the ID3v1 tag, you specify a format string:

%a - will be replaced with artist
%s - will be replaced with song
%l - will be replaced with album
%t - will be replaced with track
%y - will be replaced with year
%g - will be replaced with genre
%c - will be replaced with comment

options for %x: (where x is one of a,s,l,t,y,g,c)

%nx    => use only first n characters
          eg. artist="artist name"  %5a = "artis"

%n:cx  => use at least n characters, if %x is shorter, 
          fill it with character c
          eg. track=3       %2:0t = '03'  , 
	      artist="abc"  %5:_a = "__abc"

%n!:cx => same as %n:cx, but if %x is longer than n, cut it at n
          eg. artist="abc"      %5:_a = "__abc"  
	      artist="abcdefg"  %5:_a = "abcde"
