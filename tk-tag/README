                       tk-tag.pl
====================================================================

This program is a graphical interface for the MP3::Tag library.

It's the first released alpha version. Most buttons do not have a
function yet.

But is shows you alread the contents of the ID3v1/ID3v1.1 and ID3v2.3
tags.

And you can change the filename and the information in the ID3v1.1 Tag
and save these changes.  You cannot save any changes of the ID3v2.3
tag with this version of tk-tag.pl, although this is supported by
MP3::Tag.

To use this program, you must have the Tk and Tk::JPEG modules from
CPAN installed. And of course MP3::Tag.
